# Phone Buddy
Phone Buddy is a website project for a fictional company that sells phone accessories.
This website started from a project for a Web Technologies course, but it turned out to be very interesting to me, so I put a lot of effort into making the best out of it and improving my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website has plenty of features, such as sign-up page, log-in sistem, account modification page, forum, gallery, chat and much more.
The main issue at the moment would be the order placing option that doesn't work on the online version of the website, but works completely fine on localhost. (I'm trying to solve this problem as soon as possible ðŸ˜€).

The online version of the website can be accessed by clicking this link: https://young-badlands-27908.herokuapp.com/
All the files of the project can be found on the master branch.
